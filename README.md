# A set of Proof of Concepts for React with ES6

This repo contains a set of React samples with minimal effort from scratch:

1. [Without any build system, only with some npm scripts](https://github.com/tklepzig/react-es6-poc/tree/master/super-simple-only-npm-scripts)


It will be filled with more samples and other build systems (gulp, webpack, etc.) in future.
