# A set of minimal React samples with ES 2015 & Typescript from scratch

This repo contains a set of React samples with minimal effort from scratch:

## ES 2015
1. [Without any build system, only with some npm scripts](https://github.com/tklepzig/react-es6-poc/tree/master/super-simple-only-npm-scripts)
2. [Using Gulp (v4)](https://github.com/tklepzig/react-es6-poc/tree/master/using-gulp)
3. [Using Webpack](https://github.com/tklepzig/react-es6-poc/tree/master/using-webpack) (work in progress)

## Typescript
coming soon


It will be filled with more samples and other build systems (webpack, etc.) in future.
